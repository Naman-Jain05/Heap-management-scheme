# Heap-management-scheme
This C project simulates a basic memory management system, incorporating features for allocating and deallocating memory blocks using two primary strategies: best fit and first fit. The system utilizes two linked lists to manage memory blocksâ€”'free' for available memory and 'alloc' for allocated memory. Each memory block is represented with essential attributes such as size, tag, and process ID. The program initializes a set of free memory blocks with varying sizes, and users input the number and size of processes they wish to allocate memory for. The choice of allocation strategy (best fit or first fit) is also provided to users. The simulation then proceeds to allocate memory for the processes based on the selected strategy and showcases the resulting state of memory blocks. The system allows for the deallocation of memory, merging freed space with adjacent free blocks. The README emphasizes the project's structure, key functionalities, allocation strategies, initialization process, and provides example usage to demonstrate the memory management simulation. For future development, it suggests potential improvements such as error handling, user interface enhancements, and thorough testing for a more comprehensive and robust simulation experience.
